To use the attached scripts, on the server:

# cp escrow-receive /usr/local/sbin/escrow-receive
# vi /usr/local/sbin/escrow-receive
# ln -s /usr/local/sbin/escrow-receive /etc/smrsh/escrow-receive
# echo 'escrow: "|/usr/local/sbin/escrow-receive"' >> /etc/aliases
# newaliases

And then creating the log file and directory for escrow packets and
making sure their owner/permissions are sane.

On the client one needs to acquire the certificate to encrypt the escrow
packet and then just use the organization specific escrow-transit:

# ./escrow-transit -c ./cert.pem -v

or if using a previously generated escrow (e.g., by Anaconda):

# ./escrow-transit -f ./existing-escrow -v

After a successful delivery the user receives a confirmation e-mail.
